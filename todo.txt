add friends button - landing page bottom right - alert after maybe
    - remove coins from bg and code in; make purchases
login - also provide feedback
signup - clarify user/donator
plates - add request option, make pointer cursor
add welcome banner to launch!!!!!! - move coins thingy down, add welcome/landing page there
buildings - add spots to click, make pages
    - js onclick on landing page track coordinates - look into how css clips background image and test on diff devices, but should be able to calculate bounding box of buildings and map to page
    - or maybe just add trans banner overlay image as link and pos using css; need labels anyways
PREMIUM TRIAL - svg background would be amazing; download all assets instead of screenshotting too!!!!

implement carousel for world market/worlds
design at bottom of plates to fill space
